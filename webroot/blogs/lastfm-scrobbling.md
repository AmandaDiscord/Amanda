# Amanda now uses Last.fm!
It's been a long time coming thanks in part to pressure from a very specific donor who definitely knows who he is. (hi Suler)
This was a fun challenge and provides a lot of benefits. Not only is there ground work for future connections like last.fm, but also that users who use also use last.fm have more of an incentive to keep listening on Amanda versus some other bot which doesn't support it, so I'd say it's a win either way.

That's the big stuff for this week. I'll see you all very soon as I work on improvements <3
