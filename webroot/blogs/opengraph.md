# What is OpenGraph?
OpenGraph, or OG, is a standard for HTML meta tags which describe your site in an easy to understand format so that web crawlers, social media platforms or other applications looking to embed your webpage can easily get important data and supply that info to a reader in a rich embed.

## Usage
Discord uses OpenGraph to embed web pages like this one. You've certainly seen embeds before whether it's sent by a bot or a link someone sent has a nice display. Amanda has always had open graph meta tags in her html, but they've been generic and this kinda hurts SEO, but isn't such a huge deal. The morning of composing this, I decided that all of the website embeds being the same is kinda dumb and I might as well wrap all of the links in <> to prevent embedding, but then I had a better idea.

All of Amanda's web pages now have special opengraph tags and maybe or maybe not some secrets (or not so secrets depending on how deep you've looked into Amanda or her code). I don't anticipate this to change much and some of the og tags are literally unreachable like the main dashboard or a channel's dash since those require the browser to be logged in, otherwise, it gets redirected to the login page.

It was still fun to do. Of course, that's not all I did. I also included some missing links I forgot to add like how to add Amanda and to join our server. There was also the terms of service which I believed would be good to know:tm:


That'll be all from me today though. I have work today and presidents day is right around the corner here in the US, so I need to mentally prepare myself for the onslaught of people. Not that I mind. I love my job!
