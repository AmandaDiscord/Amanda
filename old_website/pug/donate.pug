					div Donating will always be optional. Amanda will never display ads or require any sort of actions to use any of her functions.
					div You have a few options on how to donate. You may donate via #[a(href="/to/patreon") Patreon] or via #[a(href="/to/paypal") Paypal]. To receive rewards, you must pledge or give $2 or greater.
					div We do not ask for greater than $2 and do not require payments to be monthly but if you choose, you may continue to support us.
					div We pour a lot of our hours into Amanda and any amount is appreciated and helps us immensely.
