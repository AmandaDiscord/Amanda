## Intro
Amanda is a pretty ~~and~~ powerful music bot and can sometimes be misunderstood.

This is a quick-start guide to get you jamming out with your friend(s). Amanda counts.

## Quick-Start
First off, you should join a voice channel so Amanda will know where you're gonna jam out in. Stage channels are
not supported because of technical limitations. From there, you can tell her what you wanna listen to.

The main music interface can be accessed via `/music`. From there, a pretty hefty list of what you can do
will be presented to you.

Don't get overwhelmed, what you want is `/music play:anything you want` where
you just replace "anything you want" with... Well, anything you want like despacito 2 or never gonna give you up by rick astley.
Amanda can play from a pretty exhaustive list of sources, but that's not all.

A lot of the extra controls other than play are mostly related to managing playback that you would find in your standard audio player like
skip and pause. Some extra controls are given to you that you normally wouldn't see like pitch and playback speed. There is also an option to get the
lyrics of the current playing track, assuming the track can be found on genius. How Amanda searches genius is almost entirely based on the song title, so if
a song is named something like "IN THE CRIB WITH MY HOMIES DRINKING THE AMONG US SLUSHIE AT 2AM", then the chances of finding that track are pretty slim
unless the people of the future decide to do a haha.

There are some other options, namely `frisky` and `listenmoe` which are radio stations that Amanda supports.

## Playlists
Amanda supports creating, managing and playing playlists. These playlists are managed by Amanda and can have a theoretical infinite size.
Of course, theoretical because of disk and ram limitations. Should this fact be abused, the feature will be reconsidered/removed entirely.

You can view a list of what you can do with playlists by typings `/playlists`. Challenge: Make your own playlist! Maybe I'll even jam to it some day. I know Amanda
will be jamming along with you.
